# My First Blog

This personal blog page was created to showcase thoughts and experiences.

## Description

This personal blog was created as a challenge for bootcamp students to apply everything that was learned in module 4 of class. The challenge is to apply dynamics to HTML and CSS using advanced JavaScript code. This challenge can be accomplished by:

    - Having a source code.
    - When loading the landing page you have a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.
    - When trying to submit the form with one of the fields empty you are prompted with a message that all fields need to be completed before submitting the form.
    - When the form is submitted you are redirected to the posts page.
    - When the form is submitted the data is stored to localstorage.
    - In the posts page you are presented with a header, with light/dark mode button, and a "Back" button.
    - When the back button redirects you to the previous page and are able to add another blog post.
    - When redirected to the posts page you are presented with a list of blog posts that are pulled from local storage.
    - When the blogs posted in the posts page include the blog's title, blog content, and author.
    - When local storage is inspected you are presented with a JSON array with the blog's title, content, and username.
    - When the the footer has information to the developer's portfolio and contact.
